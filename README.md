# ExpressNoteTaker

## Description

I wanted to be able to take starter front end code and complete the back end with the express routes. This app is a note taker where you can type out your notes and saved them to the sidebar. I learned how to use express and how to assign get, post, and delete routes. 

## Installation

Make sure you have all the necessary node modules installed from the package.json file with npm i 

## Usage

To use this app click get started from the homepage. Then either hit the plus sign at the top right, or begin typing in the Note Title field and Note Test field to start a new note. Once all fields are filled out hit the save icon to save the notes to the side bar. In the sidebar you can access your past notes and hit the trash can icon to delete them. 


## Credits

I used the in class activities to better understand the material and get some code from.
